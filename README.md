# Brain-tumor-classification-using-CNN-Transfer-Learning
This project aims to classify brain tumors into categories (such as glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumor) or detect their absence using a publicly available dataset of MRI scans. The dataset reflects real-world conditions, which presents additional challenges in model training and 2 evaluation.
